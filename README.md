# Simple-make-and-Makefile-tutorial

*To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your program and provides commands for updating each file. In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.*

Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:
``` shell
    make
```

suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the recipes(*A recipe is an action that make carries out*)recorded in the data base. 

## An Introduction to Makefiles

You need a file called a *makefile* to tell *make* what to do. Most often, the *makefile* tells *make* how to compile and link a program. 


### What a Rule Looks Like

Usually a rule is written in the following way:
```
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
```
A *target* is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as *clean* or *all*
A *prerequisite* is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.
